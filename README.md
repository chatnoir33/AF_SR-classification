	conv8.py → Main CNN program (Fig. 5)
	mkrp1-1.c → Generates Fig. 3(b) and 3(c) (by varying dimension and delay)
	mkrp2-1.c → Generates Fig. 4(a), referred to as 𝑆𝑃_{gray}
	mkrp2-2.c → Generates Fig. 4(b), referred to as 𝑆𝑃_{bin}
	mkrp1.c → Generates recurrence plots (RPs) for Fig. 10(b)
	heatmap.py → Generates heat maps for Fig. 9
	2sampleKStest2.py → Performs the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test
